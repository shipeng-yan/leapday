# Publications

My research falls into two broad themes. In the first research stream (papers 3-5), I follow an “outside-in” perspective, examining external factors that surround business corporations and employing an institutional theory lens to understand the underlying drivers, mechanisms, andimpacts of corporate sustainability. In my second research stream (papers 1-2), I take an “inside-out” perspective, researching internal factors from within business corporations to understand their impacts on the relevant stakeholders and the broader society.

# For Visiting students & PhD applicants
#### PhD Admission at HKU Business School
I regularly receive emails soliciting my interest in hiring PhD students. In case you don't know, PhD admission decisions in our area are committee-based. I am not currently involved in the PhD committee.

#### My style as a PhD adviser
My goal is to help you become an independent and productive scholar. I am not a micro manager and will not impose an structure unless you explicitly ask for it. I tend to separate work and life as much as I can. It is unlikely that you will receive a message from me on holidays and weekends. 

In general, I am responsive. In return, I also expect you to be responsive. You don't have to agree with me all the time, but you are not advised to repeatedly ignore my suggestions without a good explanation. This principle applies to responding to reviewers.

I am generally supportive, but you should really take the initiative to communicate your concerns in a timely manner. I am on your side when you need support. 

#### My intellectual style
As a management scholar, I appreciate empirical rigor and clever causal identification, but I deeply care about theoretical novelty and, more often than not, am excited by deep ideas. I value logical clarity and theoretical sophistication and refuse to believe that there is a trade off between the two.

#### Why PhD in Management?
1. You will NOT become a CEO of a large multinational firm after doing a PhD in management. In fact, doing this will most likely kill your chance to be a CEO. An imperfect but useful analogy is that a management scholar is to a manager as a football game analyst is to a footballer.

 

2. Management research treats managerial phenomena as if they can be scientifically analyzed and generalized and develop abstract theories to describe complex managerial issues in simple ways. Sometimes certain scholars go too far in developing theories on phenomenon that few people care about. Sometimes certain scholars are not being careful in developing explanations that are logically coherent and scientifically rigorous. Management research must balance between academic rigor and practical relevance. 

 

3. As a management scholar, you will have the opportunity to help train and educate the next generation of corporate leaders. Future and current managers love to go back to business schools to reflect on their past experiences and learn from your research if it is interesting and relevant.
